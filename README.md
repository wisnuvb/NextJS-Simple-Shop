## Additional Information

This project is not yet perfect. While I have followed the instructions and implemented the features as required, there is still significant room for improvement. Areas such as linting, code cleanliness, readability, maintainability, testing, and documentation can all be enhanced. The current implementation does not yet meet production standards. However, I have made every effort to deliver the best possible solution within the available timeframe.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. I appreciate your feedback and look forward to any suggestions you may have.
